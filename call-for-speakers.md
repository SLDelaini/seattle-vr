# Seattle VR Call for Speakers

We love learning from and sharing with each other. Whether it be showing off the bleeding edge, a development tips and tricks demo, practice for your conference talk, or just looking to share something cool you've built, we'd love to hear about it!

## I'm interested in presenting at Seattle VR

ðŸŽ‰ Yay! ðŸŽ‰

We can't wait to hear your story!

### Here's what to do next
 - Read the guidelines below
 - Submit your proposal either via our **[Google form](https://forms.gle/CXGj5eAaku4CV4PP9)** or by emailing us using our **[Speaking Request Template](#speaking-request-email-template)**
 - If the topic seems like something that our members would be excited about we'll get to work on figuring out a schedule and making a plan!

## What if it's my first time speaking?
**Wonderful!** We're here to help! ðŸ¤©

It doesn't take much for the voice in our heads to talk us out of trying something new for the first time, but we want to prove that voice wrong. Sharing your experiences takes a certain amount of bravery to be sure, but that bravery can empower others to do the same. Your unique perspective might be exactly what someone else needs to hear to take on their next big challenge.

So we'd love to help you with whatever nugget is stopping you from telling your story. Whether it be topic selection, connecting you with other experienced presenters, or if you just need someone rooting for you, we got you covered ðŸ’œ. 

And if you're more of a browse before you engage kind of person, here's some additional encouragement and resources!

## What makes a good talk?
Seattle VR is made up of a wonderfully diverse group of people with all kinds of experiences and backgrounds. Which means there's no real hard definition for a "good talk". Maybe you want to talk about a new technology, or break down something complex, or address a universal truth we're all struggling with, or I don't know... solve world hunger? It's your story! We just want to help you tell it.

**Here's an idea of things we absolutely love!**
- **The Bleeding Edge** (So you can do this now...)
- **Case Studies** (Check out this cool thing I made! *usefulness not required*)
- **Tips and Tricks** (How to deal with headset hair, What makes for a good demo, How to not alienate your developers but still hit your deadlines)
- **Funny Gifs and Emojis** (These talks get immediately approved & scheduled)

**And a few examples of things to avoid**
- **Product Pitches & Intros** (How to get started with ***X***) 
- **Negative Talks** (10 reasons why ***X*** is the worst thing that's ever been invented)
- **Framework Wars** (Why ***X*** is better than ***Y*** and you're all stupid for thinking otherwise)
