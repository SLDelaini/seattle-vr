# Seattle VR Call for Volunteers

Strictly speaking, our events would not be possible without our wonderful community of volunteers. We cannot express just how thankful we are for everyone who takes that extra step. We very literally couldn't do this without you. :heart_eyes:

**Ways to get involved:**
- Event setup/tear down
- Running demo setups
- Speaker/Demoer/Participant wrangler
- Greeter/General event helper
- Community mentorship/coaching
- And anything else that we haven't thought of that excites you!
