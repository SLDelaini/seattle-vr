# Seattle VR: Panels and Presentations

- [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-VR-Panels-Presentations/)

## What we're about

Come join the Seattle Location Based VR/AR and connect with a community of people interested in virtual reality and 3D technology. Whether you are a designer, developer, gamer, hacker, researcher, artist, entrepreneur, or are just curious, this is your chance to meet like-minded people from across Seattleâ€™s vibrant community. There's a renaissance emerging in VR sparked by the new wave of affordable consumer VR devices. This group is focused on finding ways to make content more suitable for VR/AR for arcade and location based centers vs. home-based content, along with making VR/AR more accessible and friendly for the mass market of users and to make VR/AR more mainstream.
