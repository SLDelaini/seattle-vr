# Presenting at Seattle VR

We love learning from and sharing with each other. Whether it be showing off the bleeding edge, a development tips and tricks demo, practice for your conference talk, or just looking to share something cool you've built, we'd love to hear about it!

**If you're interested in presenting at Seattle VR please email us:**

Subject: [Topic/Presentation] at Seattle VR

Include a short description covering the five W's (who, what, when, where, why). 
Just so we can get an idea of who you are, what you're looking to share, and how best we can help.

We'll get back to you shortly!
