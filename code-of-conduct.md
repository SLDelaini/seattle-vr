# Seattle VR Code of Conduct 

## TL;DR:
- Be considerate, kind, and helpful toward each other
- Give people in VR room to move
- Resolve disagreements peacefully, and bring in organizers if that doesn't seem possible
- Ask before assuming
- Speak up if you see or hear something, organizers are here for you

## The long version:

Seattle VR is committed to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices; especially technology choices.

We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants violating these rules may be expelled from the meetup **without a refund** at the discretion of Seattle VR organisers.

Harassment includes but is not limited to:

Offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity/expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual imagery/suggestions, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography/recording, sustained disruption of talks, demos, or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. 

This harassment policy applies to all meetup attendees, demoers, volunteers, and organizers and all are expected to comply immediately if asked to stop any harassing behavior.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup without refund. 

If you are being harassed, notice someone being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer or volunteer immediately. Seattle VR organizers can be identified by red name tags.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

We expect all participants to follow these policies at official meetups and meetup-related events.
