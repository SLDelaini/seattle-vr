# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I have to know how to program to come to this event?

No! We welcome anyone with an interest in working on VR and immersive technology projects. People with skill in art, sound, and design are in especially high demand throughout the weekend.

## Do I need my own VR headset?
No! That said, if you have one, you should bring it.

Many members of our community have equipment of their own that they bring and make available over the weekend. We will make available additional equipment as we are able, depending on what our sponsors are willing to provide.

Remember, though, simple VR applications will run on a smartphone with a simple static headset (such as Google Cardboard or Merge VR) and can be quite compelling, and these devices are how many people are first experiencing VR. These headsets are very easy to work with and cheap to obtain online.

Another option is get yourself an Oculus Go - these units are fully self-contained and cost just $200 on Amazon. There are several other options out there if you have time to do some research.

Note that certain VR equipment, particularly the Vive, has a tendency to interfere with other similar units nearby. As a result, we may be forced to limit the number of Vives deployed. Come prepared with an alternative if you think this might affect you.

## What should I bring?
- **A computer**: If you have a gaming PC, this would be a good choice, as VR runs best on machines with dedicated graphics cards. If you don’t have one, don’t worry - you can achieve an awful lot with a regular entry-level laptop. Even if you don’t have a computer, you’re welcome to participate, as there are many aspects of design that don’t involve working on the computer. We may be able to provide loaner computers to those who need them.
- **Extension cords and power strips**: Please bring your own. We have a few to loan out, but please come prepared.
- **Computer mouse**: Working in Unity or Unreal on a laptop trackpad might make you cry
- **Headphones**: Sound forms an important part of every VR experience, and if you want to listen to music while you work, you will need to use headphones.
- **Spare chargers**: In case your friends/teammates forget their own!
- **Pens, paper, and other drawing supplies**: It's always helpful to have something write on while you're doing design work.
- **Pillows/blankets/sleeping bags** (if you plan to stay overnight)
- **Toothbrush, toothpaste, and deodorant**: Please, for the sake of everyone else, bring and use these.

**Remember to properly label any equipment that you bring with your name.**

We will not assume liability for any equipment that is lost or stolen over the weekend. If you do lose something, though, let us know, and we'll do what we can to help you find it. If you find something, bring it to us and we'll try and find out who to return it to.

We do our best to obtain items for teams to borrow, but we aren't able to make guarantees about what will be available as these items are loaned to us from sponsors who generally can't confirm what they can loan us until close to the last minute. If at all possible, you should bring your own gear. If you can't, you can still do a lot with a whiteboard and some markers, and those we have lots of!

## Is the venue ADA compliant?
Yes. The venue is accessible by ramp on the ground level, and by elevator to the upper level, though this elevator is not as convenient as we'd like it to be.

If you think that you may have special needs around accessibility, please reach out to us so that we can work with you to ensure that your experience at the hackathon is smooth and problem-free.

## Do I need to have a particular project to work on?
No! You can just come along and see what happens. In fact, we encourage this.

There are always people with ideas for projects that you can join. Similarly, if you have an idea but need someone to help you with it, there will be people there with skills that you can leverage.

## Can I bring a project I’m already working on?
Yes, you can. If you do, however, you won’t be eligible for prizes, as that wouldn't be fair to teams that are building their entire project over the weekend. Exceptions may be made if you’re working on a distinct sub-project that builds on something else you've built in the past.

Talk to the Organizers onsite if you're unsure. All of that said, a big part of the hackathon ethos is the collaboration that occurs when people come together to create something new, so we don’t recommend this approach.

## How do I learn about developing for VR?
There are many ways to learn. If you’re a self-starter, there are excellent tutorials available online - you can pick an engine such as Unity or Unreal and work through their tutorials and examples to get a good entry-level understanding of development.

We'll have mentors onsite at the hackathon who can guide you through whatever problems or questions you may have.

## What are the prize categories?
Our prize categories have not been announced yet, but will be announced in the Seattle VR / AR Facebook group when we have them confirmed. Prize amounts will be announced at the Friday Mixer.

## What workshops will be available?
We are working with our sponsors and local experts to put on workshops and other programming both before and during the event. Look out for posts from us with more information.

## How can I get more involved?
There are a number of ways you can get more involved in the Seattle VR hackathon and the wider Seattle VR community prior to the hackathon!
