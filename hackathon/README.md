## The Seattle VR Hackathon returns!

**Registration: [2018 Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/seattle-vr-ar-hackathon-2018-tickets-48215759635)**

It's been a crazy year in VR / AR. Oculus have released the first cheap fully self-contained VR device at $200, HTC have pushed the limit with the Vive Pro, and the AR headset market is booming with lots of new devices on the horizon.

Come join us for a weekend of creativity, innovation, and learning as we explore the potential of these technologies. The Hackathon is a great opportunity to learn, to meet new people, and to get hands-on experience with VR design and development. Over the course of just 48 hours, you'll be amazed at how much awesome stuff you and your team will be able to create!

## What is a VR Hackathon?
A hackathon is a weekend-long event where people come together to make awesome stuff. Itâ€™s an amazing opportunity to meet awesome people and learn.

The VR hackathon focuses on rapidly evolving immersive technologies such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and 3D User Interfaces.

The VR hackathon isn't just about technology, however - it's about design, creation, and problem solving. If you have interest in art, graphics, 3D modelling, film, education, sound design, game design, or business, the VR hackathon will be an event you'll enjoy.

## Who can participate?
The VR hackathon is open to everyone. We welcome artists, enthusiasts, UX designers, sound artists, software engineers, critics, researchers, film-makers, developers, game designers, testers, psychologists, industry professionals, and more. If you think VR and AR are cool, you are invited to attend.

You don't have to be an expert. The VR hackathon is a great introduction to working with VR and AR, and our organizers and workshop presenters are all dedicated to helping you no matter what your skill level. We welcome everyone, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or background.

Younger attendees are welcome, too, but must have an adult present if they are younger than 16 years of age. 

VR and AR are of great interest to many industries such as medicine, manufacturing, marketing, design, construction, and many more. If you have domain expertise in any field where immersive technologies might be useful, we would love to have you attend, as your insight is key in helping us to solve real problems, even if you've never worked with these technologies before.

## How much does it cost?
Registration for the weekend costs **$70 per attendee.**

All proceeds go to paying for food, the venue, and other expenses. Anything that's left goes into prizes and other stuff to make the event cooler.

**Student tickets are at a 30% discount ($50)**, sponsored by [UW CoMotion](https://comotion.uw.edu/). 

Students will need to provide proof of enrolment at a K-12 or accredited tertiary institution in order to be admitted to the event.

We aim to run the event as close to cost as possible as we recognize that many people who would like to participate have limited budgets.

## When and where?

The event will run over the weekend of **September 14-16**, 2018, starting **6pm Friday** and ending **6pm Sunday.**

## Hackathon Rules
Specific rules for the hackathon will be announced during Opening Ceremonies, and are subject to change at that time. Further rules changes may occur throughout the weekend in response to questions and emerging issues. Such changes will be announced if and when they occur.

The following rules have been set at this time:

- Teams may have a maximum size of 8 members, excluding mentors and roving participants that assist multiple teams such as voice actors, composers, and other specialists.
- Teams may use content from third-party sources such as the asset store provided that the judges are provided with all details of this use during judging.
- Teams may use content from their own prior existing projects provided that they clear this use with the event organizers. This is to ensure that all teams have access to a similar pool of resources.
- Teams must register using the forms provided on Saturday evening in order to be eligible for prizes.
- Projects must be produced on-site at the hackathon. The organizers will make exceptions to this rule for teams that require other environments, for example, for filming a 360 scene outdoors.
- Announcements will be made using the event's Slack channel. Though attempts will be made to inform teams of any announcements in person, this is not guaranteed. It is the responsibility of each team to monitor the Slack channel for any important information.
- Teams will be allocated work spaces on Friday night, depending on their needs. We will provide pipe & drape and to act as a barrier between team workspaces in order to prevent interference between equipment.

## Refund Policy
We will refund your ticket if we receive your request to do so at least 7 days before the event. We may, at our discretion, give late refunds in extreme circumstances if we are able to re-sell your ticket.
