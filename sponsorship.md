# Seattle VR Call for Sponsors

Seattle VR relies on the community's generosity and support in order to cover event costs, maintain/upgrade equipment, provide snacks / the occasional pizza party, and so much more. And without the generosity of companies who recognize the importance of investing and supporting communities like this, none of this would be possible.

So thank you truly.

## Sponsorship Benefits
The goal of our events is to create welcoming spaces to bring the Seattle VR community together to meet, build relationships, and to learn from each other. Many of our members are looking for new opportunities to learn, collaborate, build their professional network, and to find new career/job prospects. Sponsoring an event is a great way for companies to connect and engage with those individuals.

**Examples of specific sponsorship benefits we can offer:**
- Logo/Branding on event graphics
- Social media mentions
- Complimentary event attendance 
- Company signage/branding during event
- Reserved event space for a booth/pod/setup *
- Reserved speaking/stage time during event *

_* (depends on event format)_
