# Sponsoring Seattle VR 

Seattle VR relies on the community's generosity and support in order to cover event costs, maintain/upgrade equipment, provide snacks / the occasional pizza party, and so much more. And without the generosity of companies who recognize the importance of investing and supporting communities like this, none of this would be possible.

So thank you truly.
