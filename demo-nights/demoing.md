# Demoing with Seattle VR

:heart_eyes: **First off thank you!!!** :heart_eyes:

Demo night is nothing without demos, and we love giving developers a place to present their completed, and especially their in progress, projects. 

We cannot wait to see what you've got to share!

## Applying to demo

The first step to demoing is applying through our demo form and letting us know about your project:

After you've applied, someone will be in contact shortly to confirm your demo information.

## What to expect on demo day

1. **We aim to start setting up by 5:00pm and recommend arriving as close to then as possible.** This is in order to get everything setup and smoothed out in case of any unforseen hiccups. Our goal is to have everyone setup by 6:30pm so you and your fellow demoers can mingle and check out each other's projects. Someday we'll hit that goal. 

2. **Once you're setup, feel free to venture out and grab some dinner in the area.** We only ask that you're back by 6:30pm for final prep/developer mingle/everyone's peace of mind.
   
3. **If you're not planning on going out for food, be sure to bring something to eat.** We typically have some light snacks, but it can be a long night giving demos on an empty stomach, and there isn't a whole lot of opportunity for eating once things are rolling.

4. **When giving a demo, be sure to first familarize yourself with the participant's experience with VR.** We have a wide range of experience levels each meetup, and just because the previous demo didn't need help putting the headset on doesn't mean the next person won't.

5. **Once someone has finished their demo, use the provided wipes to clean the protective band of the headset.** We want to send people home with a good experience, not a head cold.

6. If at any time during your demo you need help or assistence in any way, please let one of the organizers know ASAP and we'll do what we can to help. **Organizers can be identified by red name tags.**

7. **Aim to keep your demo ~5 minutes in length.** Obviously every demo is different, but we want to get as many eyes on your demo as possible and this helps keep the lines moving.

And above all else we want to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves so if there's anything we can do to faciliate that reach out and let us know. :purple_heart:
